# Vue-Learning-Journey

This is the beginning of my journey learning Vue.js.
Below is the YouTube tutorial I'm following as part of my Vue learning journey:

This tutorial is beginner-friendly. The instructor explains everything slowly and in detail from setting up a Vue project to deploying a finished Modern Fitness App. So, if you find other tutorials too fast to follow, this one might be a better fit. Not only will you learn Vue.js, but you'll also get hands-on practice by building a real-world app.

Weâ€™re learning Vue.js by building a Modern Fitness App.
Iâ€™m watching the tutorial to become more familiar with using Vue.js to build a complete application.

I also have a Vue roadmap to guide me throughout the process. It helps me understand what I should learn next and track my progress along the way.
ðŸ“Œ You can find a roadmap for any skill or programming language at roadmap.sh. It's been really helpful in my learning process.
